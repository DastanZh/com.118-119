## Problem #1: "Hello, World" (0.4%)

Write a program that outputs the "hello, world" message to the screen. 

### Sample Output

```
hello, world
```

## Problem #2: "A Message in a Rectangle" (0.4%)

Create a program that prints the "hello, world" greeting surrounded by the asterisk symbols.

### Sample Output

```
**************
*hello, world*
**************
```

## Problem #3: "What is Your Name?" (0.4%)

Write a program that reads a user name from the console, then forms, and prints a greeting message for that user. 

### Sample Input and Output

```
What is your name? Dmitrii
Hello, Dmitrii!
```

## Problem #4: "Operations on Two Integer Numbers?" (0.4%)

Create a program that reads two integer numbers from the user and finds their sum, difference, product, quotient, and the remainder.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 2
5 + 2 = 7
5 â€“ 2 = 3
5 * 2 = 10
5 / 2 = 2
5 % 2 = 1
```

## Problem #5: "Operations on Two Real Numbers?" (0.4%)

Create a program that reads two real numbers from the user and finds their sum, difference, product, quotient, and the remainder.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the first number: 5.1
Enter the second number: 2.6
5.1 + 2.6 = 7.699999999999999
5.1 - 2.6 = 2.4999999999999996
5.1 * 2.6 = 13.26
5.1 / 2.6 = 1.9615384615384612
5.1 % 2.6 = 2.4999999999999996
```
