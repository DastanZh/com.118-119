## Problem #1: "Swap Two Numbers" (0.4%)

Declare two integer variables (a and b), initialize them with values derived from the user input, and
swap the values between these two variables.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the 1st value: 2
Enter the 2nd value: 3
Before swapping: a = 2; b = 3;
After swapping: a = 3; b = 2;
```

## Problem #2: "Swap Without Temporary Variables" (0.4%)

Declare two integer variables (a and b), initialize them with values derived from the user input, and
swap the values between these two variables. In this task, it is prohibited to use temporary variables.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the 1st value: 2
Enter the 2nd value: 3
Before swapping: a = 2; b = 3;
After swapping: a = 3; b = 2;
```

## Problem #3: "Sum of Digits" (0.4%)

Read a four-digit integer from the standard input and find the sum of all its digits.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter a four-digit integer: 1237
The sum of all digits is 13
```

## Problem #4: "Inches to Centimeters Conversion" (0.4%)

Create an application that converts a specific value consumed from the standard input
from inches to centimeters. Note that 1 in. = 2.54 cm.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the length in inches: 17
17.00 in. = 43.18 cm.
```

## Problem #5: "Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion" (0.4%)

Create an application that implements a simple Fahrenheit to Celsius convertor. Note 
that °C = 5⁄9 × (°F − 32). 

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter temperature in degrees Fahrenheit: 114
The temperature in degrees Celsius is 45.56
```
