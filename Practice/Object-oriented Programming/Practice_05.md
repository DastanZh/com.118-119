## Developer Tools

* [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html)
* [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

On macOS, to use Processing libraries you have to install and use
[JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
To download JDK 8, you have to create a free Oracle [account](https://oracle.com).

In this Practice you have to create a number of sample GUI applications based on the provided
compiled `jar` files. You can download the `jar` files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cA4Q-u7-t7naxOFsZ7Ho8QSdb_n8rljy?usp=sharing).
