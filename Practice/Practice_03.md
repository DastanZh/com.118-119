## Problem #1: "Absolute Value of Real Number" (0.4%)

The application reads a real number from the standard input and then outputs its absolute
value.

### Sample Input and Output

```
some real number? -123.345
|-123.345| = 123.345
```

```
some real number? 12.4
|12.4| = 12.4
```

## Problem #2: "Passed or Not" (0.4%)

The application reads the total number of points earned by a student in the course "Structured
Programming" and prints whether a student passed or failed this course.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Number of points? 77
You passed “Structured Programming”!!!
You should take “Object-Oriented Programming” in the next semester
```

```
Number of points? 22
You failed “Structured Programming”!!!
You can take it again in the fall semester of 2019.
